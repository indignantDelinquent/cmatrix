## Overview

CMatrix is based on the screensaver from The Matrix website. It shows text
flying in and out in a terminal like as seen in "The Matrix" movie. It can
scroll lines all at the same rate or asynchronously and at a user-defined
speed.

This build of CMatrix is a fork of the 2.0 version maintained by Abishek V Ashok, adding some
new features, optional support for libncursesw, updated support for the original fonts,
and more.

CMatrix is inspired from 'The Matrix' movie. If you haven’t seen this movie and you are a fan of computers or sci-fi in general, go see this movie!!!

> `Disclaimer` : We are in no way affiliated in any way with the movie "The Matrix", "Warner Bros" nor
any of its affiliates in any way, just fans.

## Build Dependencies
You'll probably need a decent ncurses library to get this to work. On Windows, using mingw-w64-ncurses is recommended (PDCurses will also work, but it does not support colors or bold text).
<br>
##### For Linux<br>
Run this command to check the version of ncurses.
```
ldconfig -p | grep ncurses
```
If you get no output then you need to install ncurses. Click below to install ncurses in Linux.

## Building and installing cmatrix
To install cmatrix, Clone this repo in your local system and use either of the following methods from within the cmatrix directory.

#### Using `configure` (recommended for most linux/mingw users)
```sh
autoreconf -i  # skip if using released tarball
./configure
make
make install
```

#### Using CMake
Here we also show an out-of-source build in the sub directory "build".
(Doesn't work on Windows, for now).
```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
# to install to "/usr/local"
cmake ..
# OR 
# to install to "/usr"
#cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make
make install
```
## Usage

After you have installed **cmatrix** just type the command `cmatrix` to run it :)
```sh
cmatrix
```
Run with different arguments to get different effects.
```sh
cmatrix -[aAbBcfhklLmnopsVxk] [-C color] [-M message] [-P count] [-t tty] [-u delay]
```
Example:
```sh
cmatrix -ba -u 2 -C red
```

For more options and **help** run `cmatrix -h` <br>OR<br> Read the Manual Page by running command `man cmatrix`

_To get the program to look most like the movie, use `cmatrix -abc`_

> _Note: cmatrix is probably not particularly portable or efficient. Use the -p
option on older/slower systems to take a time penalty up front and save cycles as it runs.

## On the fly changes
You can use the following keystrokes to change CMatrix on the fly:

Key | Function
----|--------------------------------
0-9 | Adjust update speed
a   | Toggle asynchronous scroll
b   | Random bold characters
B   | All bold characters
k   | Toggle random character changes
m   | Toggle lambda mode

o   | Old-style scrolling
p   | Pause scrolling
q   | Quit the program
r   | Toggle rainbow mode
